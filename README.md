# Blind Date with a Book

## Summary
I created this project as a first introduction to the Google Books API.  Rather than do a traditional search, I chose to make it into a 'Blind Date', where the initial search only returns the book cover, genre, and number of pages.  Then, if the user is interested in one or more of the books, they can hover over the book card to see the title and author revealed.  From this view they can also connect to Google Books directly to see a preview of the book.
